# DevOps-And-CloudOps

This repo contains tools for working with various cloud providers and DevOps tools.

Many individual tools include their own README.md files with more information.

The intention is to provide "as is" tools for direct use or as examples for your own tools.

Many of the tools are written with a focus on verbose output and logging to make it easier to understand what is happening.  This can result in larger scripts, but it is intended to make it easier to understand what is happening and to make it easier to debug.  Where possible I have tried to include comments in the scripts to explain what is happening.  I will also try to focus on highlighting the core functional commands in the scripts to allow you to optionally remove the logging and comments to reduce the size of the script.
